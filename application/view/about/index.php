            <h2>About Casa</h2>
            <br>
            <p>In todayâ€™s competitive rental listing market, there are many 
                options, yet few that are specific to San Francisco State 
                University students. We found out that one of the most common 
                challenge faced by college students is searching for a place to live.
                Neither Roomster nor Craigslist are specific to college students. 
                There are thousands of results that come up when someone searches 
                for sites to rent and lease their rental units, but so are 
                the number of fraudulent cases that we see associated with it. 
                For those looking to rent their spare room to verified SF State 
                students, there are no options.</p>
            <br>
                <p>Casa provides a unique solution to SF State students looking 
                for reliable housing and for those looking to rent only to verified 
                students. Why should SFSU students browse through thousands of rental 
                listings spread across San Francisco when they can go to one site for 
                student specific needs? Casa fills a glaring hole in the market</p>
